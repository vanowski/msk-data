# Tracking social network activity data on Moscow map

A little test job focused on geographical data rendering. Written in ES6, so — in case you're not reading in late 2020's — you're gonna need the latest version of Chrome for this app to run correctly.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
bower install
gulp
```

App will be accessible either on `localhost:3000` or `localhost:9000`.
